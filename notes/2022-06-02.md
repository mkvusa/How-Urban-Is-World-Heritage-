# Workflow for Heritage Zoning and Urbanization

## Graph Analysis Workflow

### separately convert the shape files of the boundaries into raster

### overlay rasterized boundaries: core-zones, urban boundaries

### the speicify meaning of overlay and join on raster maps:
if we process two raster datasets and index all their different possible combinations of pixel colours, we get to a table of say $m \times n$ colours, provided the first map had $m$ and the scond had $n$ colours.

1. first map:has two colours urban (URB) and non-urban (NON)
2. second map: has three colours world heritage property (WHP), Buffer Zone (BFZ), and Non-Heritage (NHG)

The overlay of the two would result in 6 colours.

|     | URB | NON |
|-----|-----|-----|
| WHP | A   | B   |
| BFZ | C   | D   |
| NHG | E   | F   |


* join the layers to achieve a single picture of six clours (2 [urban, non-urban] * 3 [property, buffer-zone, not-protected])
after we make a joined image with only two colours:

we can use the [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM) model to distinguish the types of heritage zone & urban area relations (classes)

### convert the colored image into a labled graph 
* lables corresponding to the 6 type defined earlier
* links corresponding to a defined neighbouhood (such as von neuman, sharing an edge)

### identify islands 
* islands are group of cennected vertices that have identical label

### simplify the graph
* simplify the graph by merging all the vertices of a island into a single vertex
* adding the count attribute representing the original number of vertices in that island

this way each island is going to be represented by a vertex, and each edge represents the connections of the islands ie if there was an edge between the subsidiery pixels of them

### create the attributed graph embedding from the simplified graph
* (to be discovered)
* there are two options for the embedding process
    1. embed each node into a 2D space, whcih you plot
    2. embed the whole graph into a (arbitrary) high dimenional space as a data point

### conduct a clustering on the graph embeddings to identify the main type of configurations
* in each case the clustering might function differently, 
    * for the first option, fter the embedding we need to perform the graph matching and correspondingly measure the distance between them
    * for the secodn one you will treat the graph as a vector
    
### lable the clusters (ad-hoc)
* observe the configurational qualities of each cluster

## Spatiotemporal Analysis Workflow

### We start from DLR satelite images with yearly steps
* these images are already labled with respect to urban / non-urban


### we basically iterate through the graph analysis workflow upto the colored image
* we borrow the images representing the heritage lable since they are static during the time
* we should factor in the time that the heritage property has been identified and the protection plan has been implemented
* we need to achieve the 6 colored image for each site, each timestep

### we perform timeseries analysis on the pixels
* to identify wheather the identification of the heritage property and implementation of the protection plan has any correlation with the change in the urban lable of the pixels
* this can be done by an one-way ANOVA on the level of buffer-zone vs property vs non-protected-area to test if there is a statistically considerable difference of urbanization process for example 2020 vs 2015
* since this type of ANOVA is normally conducted on two snapshots, we need to discover how we can perform such an analysis on the time series
